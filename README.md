# Sabotage
Sabotage is a social deduction game similar to Murder Mystery or Trouble in Terrorist Town  
It is split between 3 roles, each with their own goals and means of attack or defense: 

### Saboteur
The bad guy, they have to kill all of the [Innocents](#innocent) and [Detectives](#detective) without being revealed as a Saboteur.  
Work with other Saboteurs to sneakily kill others without being caught and blend in with the crowd as to not seem suspicious.  
Saboteurs can see everyone's roles, use this to your advantage. Target [Detectives](#detective) and get an increased reward.  
Avoid each map's Tester and the [Detective's](#detective) Portable Tester, as that is used to find out a player's role.

### Detective
The Detective is a wild card to [Saboteurs](#saboteur) as they are equipped with a Portable Tester that can determine someone's role,
be careful using this though, as it has limited uses. [Innocents](#innocent) and [Saboteurs](#saboteur) both know who the Detectives are,
make sure to protect yourself or else you will be targetted.

### Innocent
The Innocents work with [Detectives](#detective) to find out and kill all [Saboteurs](#saboteur).  
Gain the trust of [Detectives](#detective), protect them and use your numbers to ambush and kill [Saboteurs](#saboteur)  
Use each map's Tester to prove your innocence and to find [Saboteurs](#saboteur).

## Installation
This mod requires [Plasmid](https://modrinth.com/mod/plasmid), [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) to work.  
It is meant to be installed in a Server, installing it on a Client will likely work, but it is not tested and as such I do not recommend doing so.
